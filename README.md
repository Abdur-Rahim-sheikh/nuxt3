## Lessons
1. NuxtLink: We use this because
    1. It helps to navigate between pages without refreshing the page which means it does not make a new request to the server. making it faster.
    2. It helps to prefetch the page which means it loads the page in the background so that when the user clicks on the link the page is already loaded.
    3. It helps to add the active class to the link when the page is active.
